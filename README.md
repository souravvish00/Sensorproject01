## Machine Learning Sensor Project

• Developed systems to detect sensor anomalies such as bias, drift, saturation, spike, stuck and noise 

• Applied ML/DL models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LSTM/autoencoders) with EDA-driven 
  feature engineering 

• Ensured explainability with SHAP or model interpretability tools 

• Designed evaluation metrics: detection accuracy, false positive/negative minimization, latency thresholds 

• Deployed trained models as REST APIs using Flask and hosted on AWS EC2.
